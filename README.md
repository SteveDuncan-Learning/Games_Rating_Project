# Games_Rating_Project
Practice project using Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, Handlebars.

Functionality is for rating games. Registration, Login and Admin functions use bcrypt and jsonwebtoken.
Additions I made to the project:
  Added logic to calculate and display the average user rating for each game.
  Separated the route handling logic into controllers.
